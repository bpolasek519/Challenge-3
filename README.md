## Technologies

This application is written in Python. The Python libraries used are [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [MatPlotLib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). We used Pandas so we could easily handle and analyze our data and we used MatPlotLib to allow us to create simple and appealing visualizations.
